1.The clarity and educational value of the content.
The content of the TypeScript is solid. Good at explaining how to run the TypeScript compiler. A great refrense to come back to if I forget anything. The walk through is explicit and demonstrative.

2.How TypeScript might influence your coding practices.
The Zen of Python says "Explicit is better than Implicit." TypeScript will force me to be more explicit in my coding practices. The same could be said for good naming conventions but in a language that can be difficult to read, TypeScript provides a lot of value. I am excited about having a clearer understanding of parameters and function returns.

3.Areas you're confident in and those needing more exploration.
I am feeling pretty confident about being able to write solid, logical functions in JavaScript. I am less familar with working the DOM, creating and grabbing elements.
