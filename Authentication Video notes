## How authentication works
User enters data into the Client server
    - client sends data to the server for validation (because it is not secure to do this in the client
    - client & server are decoupled, they communicate throug the HttpClient angular offers
        - therefore can't stor a session on the server b/c it knows nothing about the client
    - if all the data is valid the server will send the client a token (a JSON Web Token)
        - the token is an encoded string that has a lot of metadata that can be unpacked & read by the client, generated on the server which only the server can validate incoming tokens
        - the client/our browser/ our angular app stores that token (in localstorage) & attaches the token to any request that thereafter is sent to the server which needs to be authenticate  
        - the token is attached in the header or as a quersy parameter to the request we are sending to the server
    - token cannot be generated by the client
